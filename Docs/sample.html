 <div><h3>So what's special about this project?</h3>
			<p>
				Whenever someone visits a site tracked by Google Analytics with javascript disabled browser, the visit is not recorded.</p>
				<p><a href="http://remysharp.com">Remy Sharp</a> solved this brilliantly with this <a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/10/15/the-missing-stat-noscript/">WordPress plugin</a>.</p>
				<p>This is the .NET porting of that plugin, which enables both ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Webforms users to easily add a Google Analytics snippet, which includes a small &lt;NOSCRIPT /&gt; refering an image called <em>__utm.gif</em> loaded from Google's servers.</p>
				<p>The request made to that image also includes the tracking parameters for the Google Analytics dashboard:</p>
				<p><img src="$(gasample)" alt="Dashboard result" /></p>
